A Python implementation of an agent navigating a hexagonal grid to collect treasures while avoiding obstacles, using A* search.File	

<!-- Description -->
Game.py:            Main game logic, A* solver, and heuristics.
State.py:           Tracks agent state (position, energy, treasures, etc.).
Node.py:            Represents a grid cell (treasures, traps, rewards).
Visualisation.py:   Shows path taken by the algorithm
locations.txt:  Map file

<!-- Running the game -->
Run the Main.py file to simulate the A* search in the game.
